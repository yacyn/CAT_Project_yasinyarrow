        About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
 My name is Yasin Abdi, and I am a student at KCA University pursuing a degree in Applied Computing. I am passionate about coding, and my love for it stems from an unexpected source - watching movies.

Whenever I watch films that showcase the power of technology, the excitement and curiosity they evoke within me are simply unmatched. Witnessing how coding can bring imaginary worlds to life on the big screen is awe-inspiring. It inspired me to dive deeper into the world of programming and explore the endless possibilities it offers.

As a student of Applied Computing, I have been fortunate enough to gain an oppotunity to learn various programming languages and gain hands-on experience in developing software and applications. The ability to turn lines of code into something tangible and functional is incredibly rewarding to me.

Apart from coding, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of movies. I appreciate the creativity and artistry that goes into creating captivating stories and visually stunning cinematic experiences. It's fascinating how technology plays a crucial role in bringing these stories to life, and it further fuels my love for coding.

In my free time, you can find me experimenting with new coding projects, honing my skills, and exploring different programming techniques. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to apply my knowledge and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions.

I believe that the combination of my passion for coding and my appreciation for the magic of movies gives me a unique perspective and a drive to continuously learn and grow in the field of Applied Computing.
